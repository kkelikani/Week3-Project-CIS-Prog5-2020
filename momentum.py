Program: That accepts mass in kg to come up with objects momentum
Author: Kaleo Kelikani

1.Compute mass * velocity

2. Input = mass kg

3.Computations are:

# Formulas to obtain objects momentum is mass x velocity

"""
# Request input for the radius of the sphere
mass=int(input("Enter the size of the mass is kg of object:  "))
mass
velocity=int(input("Enter the velocity in meters per second:  "))
momentum=(mass * velocity)
print("The momentum of the object is :  ", momentum,"kg m/s")
